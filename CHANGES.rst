Tequila-django
==============

Changes

v 0.9.12 on Apr 19, 2018
------------------------

* Remove the check-and-fail for entries in the packages.json
  ``devDependencies`` block.  This was just protecting against a
  corner of npm, no other portion of the deployment depends on it, and
  it will cause deployments to new environments to fail since npm
  hasn't been installed yet.


v 0.9.11 on Mar 19, 2018
------------------------

* Add additional env vars to account for Celery 4's renamed
  configuration settings.

  NOTE: if you are upgrading from Celery 3 to Celery 4, be
  aware of the changes made to Celery's setting names.
  Most relevant to tequila-django, the changed names
  include the environment-variable-dependent
  settings determined by the secrets ``broker_host``
  and ``broker_password``.

  Old setting names will still work after the change, but
  users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.
  Settings can be upgraded automatically using the Celery 4
  command line interface.

  For more details, see the Celery 4 `"Whatâ€™s new in Celery
  4.0" <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-4.0.html>`_
  changelog document, in particular the "`For Django
  users and others who want to keep uppercase names"
  <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-4.0.html#lowercase-setting-names>`_
  section.

v 0.9.10 on Mar 2, 2018
-----------------------

* Move celerybeat's pid file to an in-memory filesystem.


v 0.9.9 on Dec 12, 2017
-----------------------

* Throw a failure if the presence of packages in the project
  package.json ``devDependencies`` object is detected.  Projects will
  need to move their dependencies into the ``dependencies`` object
  instead, or disable the check by setting ``ignore_devdependencies``
  to ``true``.


v 0.9.8 on Nov 27, 2017
-----------------------

* Properly quoting all environment variables.

  Previously, most of the Ansible variables that were dropped into the .env file were not being quoted within that file, making many characters (spaces, characters with special meaning to the shell, etc.) unsafe for use within this file.  The workaround was to double-quote your Ansible variables, but now with this change any such variables need to be identified and the extra quoting removed.


v 0.9.7 on Oct 19, 2017
-----------------------

* Work around for Ansible bug #25431. Store Github deploy key in a fact
  so it's available regardless of result of previous task.


v 0.9.6 on Sep 21, 2017
-----------------------

* Added an ``additional_domains`` variable, to allow for the
  multi-domain case to be supported in the Django settings file.


v 0.9.5 on Sep 13, 2017
-----------------------

* Added a ``cloud_staticfiles`` boolean variable, that determines
  whether to run ``collectstatic`` only once or not.


v 0.9.4 on Sep 6, 2017
----------------------

* Mark the Django migration task to only run once.


v 0.9.3 on Aug 28, 2017
-----------------------

* Allow Git checkout of source tree on Vagrant environments instead
  of only supporting source_is_local=true.

* Ignore .env and node_modules when rsync-ing source tree for
  source_is_local processing.


v 0.9.2 on Aug 17, 2017
-----------------------

* Adjustment to the Django migrate task to improve its speed, and a
  suggestion for a project-wide setting to improve it further.


v 0.9.1 on July 20, 2017
------------------------

* Convert the collectstatic task into a handler.  This is needed so
  that it happens after the ``npm run build`` step, so that the files
  generated from that are included.


v 0.9.0 on July 18, 2017
------------------------

* Remove the nodejs installation and package management in favor of
  the geerlingguy/nodejs Ansible role.

  .. IMPORTANT::

     To upgrade to this version, you will have to make the following
     changes to your deployment files.

     1. Add the geerlingguy/nodejs role to
        deployment/requirements.yml, and bump the version of
        tequila-django::

          ---
          - src: https://github.com/caktus/tequila-django
            version: v0.9.3
            name: tequila-django

          - src: geerlingguy.nodejs
            version: 4.1.2
            name: nodejs
          ...

     #. Install the new role, and make sure that tequila-django gets
        upgraded.  Since ``ansible-galaxy`` does not at this time seem
        to have support for version upgrades, either explicitly remove
        the tequila-django directory from deployment/roles/, or use
        ``ansible-galaxy uninstall tequila-django``, before running
        the command to install the roles from the requirements.yml
        file.

     #. Include the configuration variables for geerlingguy/nodejs in
        your project-wide variables file (usually
        deployment/playbooks/group_vars/all/project.yml)::

          ---
          nodejs_version: "6.x"
          nodejs_install_npm_user: "{{ project_name }}"
          nodejs_package_json_path: "{{ source_dir }}"
          nodejs_config_unsafe_perm: true

        If you previously had anything configured under the variable
        ``global_npm_installs``, rename this variable to
        ``nodejs_npm_global_packages``.  Note that
        ``nodejs_config_unsafe_perm`` has to be set to ``true`` in
        order for the global npm installs to work for
        ``nodejs_install_npm_user`` set to anything other than root.

     #. If you previously had a different version of nodejs installed
        using a .deb package, you should probably uninstall it, and
        remove any PPA source file associated with it (if used).

     #. Modify your deployment/playbooks/web.yml file (or equivalent)
        to include the nodejs role _after_ the tequila-django role::

          ---
          - hosts: web
            become: yes
            roles:
              - tequila-nginx
              - { role: tequila-django, is_web: true }
              - nodejs
